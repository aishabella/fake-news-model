# Data Science Machine Learning Project - Predicting Fake News
Scenario:
As a data scientist employed by Today's Network, you will have to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to combat fake content problems. It is believed that machine-learning technologies hold promise for significantly automating parts of the procedure human fact-checkers use today to determine if a story is real or a hoax.

Datasets:
- news.csv (1.9MB)
- news_train.csv (1.4MB)
- news_test.csv (147 KB)

R studio was used to perform all data modelling operations. Scenario and data were both obtained from Swinburne University online 2022.
